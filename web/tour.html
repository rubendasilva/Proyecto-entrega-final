                    Colombia is a land of contrasts, from its bustling cosmopolitan cities to its tranquil rural
                    landscapes.
                    The country boasts world-class attractions: the historic walled city of Cartagena, the coffee
                    triangle,
                    the lush jungles of the Amazon, and pristine beaches along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts.
                    Colombia is
                    also a paradise for adventure lovers, with opportunities for hiking, scuba diving, paragliding, and
                    exploring ancient ruins. And let’s not forget the people—Colombians are known for their warmth and
                    hospitality, making your visit even more special.<br> <br>
                    <b>Must-See Destinations in Colombia with Travel NZ</b> <br>

                    Nestled
                    high in the Andes at an altitude of 2,640 meters (8,660 feet), Bogotá is Colombia’s bustling capital
                    and
                    cultural hub. Start your journey at the Gold Museum, which houses over 55,000 pieces of
                    pre-Columbian
                    gold, then explore the charming La Candelaria district with its colonial-era buildings, cobblestone
                    streets, and colorful murals. A ride up to Monserrate offers panoramic views of the city and the
                    surrounding mountains, making it the perfect place for photos. Whether you’re enjoying Bogotá’s
                    vibrant
